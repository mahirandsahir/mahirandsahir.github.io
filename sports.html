        <h1 id="firstHeading"> What makes Soccer fun</h1>
        <p> Soccer is a popular sport played all over the world. Even though it has only been popular 
            in the United States for the past 30 years, soccer has been a long time favorite most everywhere else. 
            The sport dates back to the Egyptians, who played games involving the kicking of a ball. 
            Now, the sport has grown to a global pastime, 
            including men’s and women’s teams, and the World Cup (which is played every four years). </p>

      <h1 id="secondHeading">Tandem Biking :</h1> 
      <p>A tandem bicycle or twin is a form of bicycle (occasionally a tricycle) designed to be ridden
         by more than one person. The term tandem refers to the seating arrangement (fore to aft, not side by side),
          not the number of riders. Patents related to tandem bicycles date from the mid 1880s. Tandems can reach higher 
          speeds than the same riders on single bicycles, and tandem bicycle racing exists. As with bicycles for 
          single riders, there are many variations that have been developed over the years.</p>
